# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This study guide was created to help bootcamp students study the basics of bootcamp. I built this project to learn and further my skills and knowledge in the fields of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. This project solves the problem of having prework notes all in on place, as well as a platform where I got to practice the skills I have already learned. I learned the definitions and working-basics of GitHub repositories, CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
